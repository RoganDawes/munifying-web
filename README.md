# munifying-web

Experimental in-browser implementation of CVE-2019-13054/CVE-2019-13054 from Chrome 78+.

The page utilizes the new WebHID API to extract AES encryption keys from vulnerable dongles.

As this is a PoC, there is no proper error handling implemented. The code is supposed to
work with Logitech receivers utilizing a Texas Instruments Chip (R500, SPOTLIGHT, LightSpeed
Logitech Unifying with RQR24.x). The vulnerability was patched with firmware RQR24.10 / RQR24.11
for Logitech Unifying receivers.

## How to use

Browse to [https://mame82.github.io/munifying-web/](https://mame82.github.io/munifying-web/) with
Chrome 78+. Once the 'Experimental Web Platform features' are enabled, the `dump` button should
present a dialog, which let you choose from connected Logitech receivers. If the dongle is
vulnerable, extracted keys will be printed to the page.

Everything runs locally in the browser.

Inspect the `main.js` file to adopt this for other projects.
